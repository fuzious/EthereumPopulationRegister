<h1>Ethereum Population Register</h1>

<h2>What is EPR?</h2>

An Ethereum decentralised application to improve genuineness by passing the reports of the peers to
the higher authority only after it has been passed by a set of randomly chosen peers. Since there is
no admin, therefore, manipulating the reports/results wouldn't be possible and voting by a randomly
chosen set helps in genuineness.
